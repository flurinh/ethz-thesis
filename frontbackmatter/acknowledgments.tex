Bruno and Monika---the reason a dreamer like me managed to get through university. My brothers---the funniest people in my life.

\thanks{My school teachers, whom I spent many years annoying but remember every last one of. My first-grade biology teacher was a botanist who, for reasons I still don't understand, explained the hexadecimal system to a room of six-year-olds. It stuck.}

\thanks{Twelve years at ETH brought me into contact with remarkable researchers, students, and professors. The Paul Scherrer Institute and its staff provided an environment where computational and experimental work met daily.}

\thanks{Xavi---for the mentorship, and for the excitement about protein structures that lit a spark.}

\thanks{This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no.\ 192780).}

\thanks{We acknowledge Claude Opus-4.5 and Opus-4.6 (Anthropic) for editing assistance in preparing this manuscript. Claude was also used as the LLM in the ProtOS-MCP example (\autoref{ch:protos-mcp}). The scientific work, analysis, and conclusions are entirely my own.}
