Bruno and Monika---the reason a dreamer like me managed to get through university. My brothers---I learned more from them than they probably realize.

\thanks{My school teachers, whom I spent many years annoying but remember every last one of. My first-grade biology teacher was a botanist who, for reasons I still don't understand, explained the hexadecimal system to a room of six-year-olds. It stuck. I hope this thesis makes up for at least some of the trouble.}

\thanks{Vladimir---for giving me the chance at a PhD at ETH, my home university.}

\thanks{Xavi---for the mentorship, and for giving me remarkable freedom in my research from an early stage. He let me explore while always keeping me on track.}

\thanks{Everyone in the group deserves thanks for welcoming me into the lab, teaching me to use a pipette, sharing coffee, and patiently listening to my ramblings about AI, language models, and whatever else I was excited about that week.}

\thanks{Twelve years at ETH brought me into contact with remarkable researchers, students, and professors. The Paul Scherrer Institute and its staff provided an environment where computational and experimental work met daily.}

\thanks{This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no.\ 192780).}

\thanks{We acknowledge Claude Opus-4.5 and Opus-4.6 (Anthropic) for editing assistance in preparing this manuscript. Claude was also used as the LLM in the ProtOS-MCP example (\autoref{ch:protos-mcp}). The scientific work, analysis, and conclusions are entirely my own.}
